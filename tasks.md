# Active Tab Split Project Tasks

## Project Overview
Active Tab Split is a React web application (JavaScript, Create React App) that enables users to view multiple websites side by side in a single browser window. Inspired by Windows Snap Layouts, it allows users to select from various grid layouts (1, 2, 3, or 4 panels) and assign a different website to each panel. The project uses React and regular CSS for styling.
